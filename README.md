## About this app
This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) which can be installed on your phones and is independent of the platform you're using. 

This app is developed to show the temperature of Ajmer city specifically. The UI of this app is extremely simple to use and is designed for elderly people. 

To achieve this I'm using a service worker. A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction.

## How to use this on your phone

2. Expand options

3. Tap 'Add to Home Screen'

5. Check your home screen for the installed app.
